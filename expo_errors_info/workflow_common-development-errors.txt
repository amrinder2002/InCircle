Metro bundler ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:19001




An error is preventing the connection to your local development server.


Run 
rm -rf .expo
 to clear your local state. Check for firewalls or 
proxies
 affecting the network you are currently connected to.




Module AppRegistry is not a registered callable module (calling runApplication)




An error in your code is preventing the JavaScript bundle from being executed on startup.


Try running 
npx expo start --no-dev --minify
 to reproduce the production JS bundle locally. If possible, connect your device and access the device logs via Android Studio or Xcode. Device logs contain much more detailed stacktraces and information. Check to see if you have any changes or errors in your Babel configuration. In some rare cases, this issue could be caused by incompatibility between the Metro JavaScript minifier and certain code in your app (

).




npm ERR! No git binary found in $PATH




Either you do not have git installed or it is not properly configured in your 
$PATH
.


Install git
 if you have not already. Otherwise, check how to set it in your 
$PATH
 based on your OS.




XX.X.X is not a valid SDK version




The SDK version you are running has been deprecated and is no longer supported.


Upgrade your project
 to a supported SDK version. If you are using a supported version and see this message, you'll need to update your Expo Go app.




React Native version mismatch




The development server running in your terminal is bundling a different version of React Native than the app in your device or simulator.


Align your versions of react-native
 by checking the versions in your 
app.json
 and 
package.json




Application has not been registered




There is a mismatch between the AppKey registered in the native and JS portion of your app.


Align your AppKey
 with the native side of your project.




Application not behaving as expected




It is possible caches may be preventing you from seeing the current state of your application.


Clear all caches associated with your project in 
Unix-like
 or 
Windows
 systems.
