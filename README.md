# InCircle

InCircle is a mobile‑first, privacy‑focused real estate marketplace designed for
Indian agents, brokers, builders and channel partners. It enables verified
professionals to collaborate, share listings and respond to property demands
within their trusted network.

This repository contains a minimal React Native/Expo project with a simple home
screen. The app currently renders a basic header and example content. To start
developing, edit `App.js` and run one of the provided Expo scripts:

```bash
npm start   # open Expo developer tools
npm android # run on Android device or emulator
npm ios     # run on iOS simulator
npm web     # run in the browser
```

Make sure you have the Expo CLI installed. See the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev) for full details.
